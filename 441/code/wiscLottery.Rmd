```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Descriptive Statistics
We are using the data "wiscLottery.csv" and are interested in the relationship between the population (POP) and the number of tickets sold (SALES)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
wisc_lottery <- read.csv("WiscLottery-1.csv", header = TRUE)

attach(wisc_lottery)
names(wisc_lottery)

summary(wisc_lottery$SALES)
summary(SALES)


par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(wisc_lottery$SALES)
hist(POP)

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(POP, SALES)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
