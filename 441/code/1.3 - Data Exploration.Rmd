## 1.3 - Data Exploration - Descriptive Statistics
We are using the data "wiscLottery.csv" and are interested in the relationship between the population (POP) and the number of tickets sold (SALES)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
wiscLottery <- read.csv("WiscLottery-1.csv", header = TRUE)

attach(wiscLottery)
names(wiscLottery)

summary(wiscLottery$SALES)
summary(SALES)


par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(wiscLottery$SALES)
hist(POP)

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(POP, SALES)
```

## Comments
There seems to be a positive relationship between population and sales.

## Linear relation between population and sales

``` {r, echo = TRUE} 
lm1 <- lm(SALES ~ POP, data = wiscLottery)
lm2 <- lm(SALES ~ POP + ZIP, data = wiscLottery)
lm1
lm2

```
